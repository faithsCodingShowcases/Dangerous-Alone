# Dangerous-Alone
Python Sprite Game that allows for movement, attack with weapon, attack with fire, and healing. Objects were placed on a tile map. Includes Code, Csv references, audio, and graphics. 


In order to use this Project you will have to change the file paths to your computer systems paths within the python files. 
I recomenet storing all the graphics within a graphics folder, same goes with the particals. 
You may use or modiphy the game as you please.
